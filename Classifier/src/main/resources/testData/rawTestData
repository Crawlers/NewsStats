'A columnist with the Jaffna-based Udayan newspaper, who is also a doctor attached to the Anuradhapura Blood Bank, has been arrested and handed over to the police on the charge of entering an army facility accommodating the newly-recruited Tamil women in Kilinochchi.  The suspect has been identified as Dr. Ratnasingham Shivashankar and the investigations have revealed that he had entered the army facility in Bharathipuram, Kilinochchi on Sunday pretending to be a relative of one of the new recruits. However, he had been questioning some of the Tamil recruits at the camp, and they had informed the authorities regarding the suspicious intruder.  Initial investigations had revealed the intruder, who was serving at the Jaffna Hospital earlier, had been contributing to the Tamil daily.  However, the army suspects that he had entered the premises on false pretexts, with the intention of disrupting the training process of the recruits.  Military Spokesperson, Brigadier Ruwan Wanigasooriya told Ceylon Today the intruder is being held on charges of entering the army facility on false pretexts and non-disclosure of his proper identity. He is currently being questioned by the Terrorist Investigations Division (TID) in Mankulam. (CN)',crime
'The evaluation fee for the GCE O/L examination answer scripts has not been increased for approximately eight years, the Ceylon Teachers\' Service Union (CTSU) alleged yesterday.   Speaking to Ceylon Today, General Secretary of the CTSU, Mahinda Jayasinghe, claimed it was unfair for teachers to be paid the same amount of money they were paid almost 10 years ago, especially as the cost of living has skyrocketed since then. An increment of at least 100\% should be granted, Jayasinghe opined.   \"The bus fares are not the same as they were 10 years ago. The prices of goods are much higher now. People should at least be able to cover the cost of how much they spend to get to and from the evaluation centres,\" Jayasinghe pointed out.   The fees granted to the teachers should be doubled, he said, explaining they were paid according to the subjects they evaluated, and that the evaluation of some subjects is paid even as little as Rs 30 per paper, and should thus be increased to at least Rs 60.   Meanwhile, commenting on the inefficiency of the education authorities, Jayasinghe said last Sunday (30), teachers in Tangalle were informed that they should report to Tangalle Maha Vidyalaya to evaluate papers, when the paper marking activities were actually taking place at the Tangalle Balika Vidyalaya.   \"The letters had instructed them to go to Tangalle Maha Vidyalaya. They were informed to report to the wrong place, due to a mistake,\" he said.',other
'The newly drawn up National Health Policy is to be implemented from today, the Ministry of Health said yesterday. Minister of Health, Maithripala Sirisena declared the policy will be implemented from 1 January 2013 to 2017, and it will focus on improving the standards in the health sector.   The policy, which had been in the pipeline for two years, was formed by the Planning Division of the ministry, under the guidance of Minister Sirisena, with experts from the health sector, provincial health officials and various professionals from a number of fields, coming together to cover 24 separate units belonging to the health sector. Minister Sirisena said the newly formed policy will address a new target to be achieved in the health sector each year, and said it had outlined the monetary allowances for each step as well as a detailed course of action for achieving each milestone.   He said the five-year policy had the potential to achieve a lot more than the previous National Health Policy, which was drawn up to address the concerns of the health sector for just one year. Minister Sirisena placed emphasis on the fact that Sri Lanka was head and shoulders above other Asian countries when it came to the number of cases of non-infectious diseases. He pointed out that over 650 deaths occurred per day in Sri Lanka due to such diseases as heart attacks, diabetes, cancers, respiratory diseases and high blood pressure.   The ministry has decided on the year 2013 as the year to combat such non-infectious diseases, and carry out programmes to create awareness among the public of the effects of alcoholism and smoking. Minister Sirisena also said steps will be taken to create awareness among the people on the ill effects of smoking, and this will include the passing of the law mandating that 80\% of a cigarette pack should be covered with depictions of mouth cancer, as well as a number of other new laws in an effort to make the policy effective.',other

'Australia are eyeing a series sweep over battered Sri Lanka in a poignant third Test starting in Sydney on Thursday overshadowed by the death of Tony Greig and marking the end of Mike Hussey\'s prolific career.   Michael Clarke\'s Australians swept Sri Lanka aside by an innings and 201 runs to win the second Test inside three days in Melbourne and seal the series after a comprehensive win in the first Test. The Lions have lost talismanic batsman Kumar Sangakkara with a fractured finger and have other injury issues, adding to an uphill task as Sri Lanka chase their first ever Test win Down Under at the 13th attempt.   Given the gulf between the third-ranked Australians and Sri Lanka, ranked number six, the chances of an against-the-odds win appear remote as Australia build towards their tour of India, starting next month.   Sri Lanka\'s efforts for redemption come as the cricket world mourns the death of former England captain and broadcaster Greig from a heart attack at the age of 66 in Sydney on Saturday. Sangakkara said Greig had been a champion of Sri Lankan cricket. \"Tony Greig in Sri Lanka will be very fondly remembered for embracing Sri Lankan players and the Sri Lankan people from 1995 onwards, and getting behind us and promoting us positively across the world,\" Sangakkara said.   \"He\'s been a very good friend of the Sri Lankan cricket team. He has been a great non-Sri Lankan ambassador. Everyone in Sri Lanka feels sad.\"   Both teams will observe a minute\'s silence before the start of the Test and will wear black armbands in his honour. The match also marks the final Test appearance of veteran batting mainstay Hussey, who announced at the weekend that he wanted to spend more time with his four young children. Hussey, 37, holds the record for most Test centuries against Sri Lanka, with five tons among his 19 hundreds in 78 Tests at 51.52.   \"I feel like I can come into this last Test match with no pressure whatsoever,\" said Hussey. \"I can just really go out there and enjoy it.\"   Depending on pitch and weather conditions there could be a Test debut for all rounder Glenn Maxwell, who has come into the Australian squad as a replacement for injured Shane Watson, while left-armer Mitchell Starc will return. Experienced batsman Thilan Samaraweera said his Sri Lankan team-mates were desperate to put the Melbourne debacle behind them. \"It was really hard to digest that defeat, but that\'s the past now,\" Samaraweera said, adding the team could make history by winning their first Test in Australia.\"That is the kind of attitude we are taking into the New Year\'s Test,\" he said. Skipper Mahela Jayawardene will be under extra pressure to perform in the absence of Sangakkara who, like his skipper, has 10,000 Test runs under his belt. Jayawardene has struggled for runs away from home in recent years and has gone 26 innings in away Tests without making a half-century. (The News International)',other
'The Colombo Chief Magistrate ordered the deportation of 100 Taiwanese and four Chinese nationals, arrested for their involvement in money laundering through the internet, using Sri Lanka as their base.

'Union Minister of State V. Narayanasamy today blamed the Tamil Nadu government for its “inaction” to facilitate a dialogue between Indian fishermen and their counterparts in Sri Lanka.   Though the External Affairs Ministry Secretary had written twice to the Tamil Nadu government recently for a dialogue to ensure protection of fishermen, the State government had not shown any response to the Centre’s initiative, Minister of State in the PMO Narayanasamy said.   Only through an agreement between the leaders of Tamil Nadu fishermen outfits and their counterparts in the Island Republic could the present hardships being faced by fishermen of Puducherry and Tamil Nadu be brought to an end, he told reporters in Puducherry.   Emphasising the need to demarcate the zones within which the fishermen of the State and Sri Lanka could carry on their avocation, the Secretary to the External Affairs Ministry had written twice to the Tamil Nadu Chief Secretary for the dialogue. “No response has, however, been shown by the Tamil Nadu government so far to these communications,” he said.   Replying to a question on the UPA’s Prime Ministerial candidate, Mr. Narayanasamy said as far as Congress was concerned, party leader Sonia Gandhi was the ultimate authority to decide on the matter, though there were several persons eligible to become the Prime Minister.   “Let us not indulge in any discussion now,” he said.   Mr. Narayanasamy claimed that the UPA had never shown political considerations between Congress ruled and non-Congress ruled States in allocation of funds for the implementation of the centrally sponsored schemes.   He said Uttar Pradesh was earmarked Rs. 3,500 crore for implementation of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee programme. Tamil Nadu came next in the allocation of funds as it had been earmarked Rs. 3000 crore for the scheme.   “The Centre holds the scales even and funds are earmarked as per provisions in the Constitution, decisions taken at the National Development Council and in keeping with the approval of the Planning Commission,” he said.   Mr. Narayanasamy said a team of officials of the Comptroller and Auditor General would visit Puducherry soon to ascertain the reasons for “diversion” of funds from one department to another.   “Such diversion of funds cannot be done without prior approval of the Planning Commission but this is taking place in Puducherry as a routine affair”, he alleged.

'The Deyata Kirula exhibition is wasteful, corrupt and an absolute farce, and has little or no benefit to the people in the country, Deputy Leader of the United National Party (UNP), Sajith Premadasa charged.    Addressing the media in Narahenpita today, Premadasa condemned the excessive spending of the government on what he termed as insignificant events that have no direct benefit for the people, but for the enjoyment and amusement of the affluent.   According to him, despite spending a colossal amount of money, no proper benefits have been bestowed on the people as a result of the Deyata Kirula, the annual exhibition that takes place following independence celebrations.   The UNP Deputy Leader also said there are hundreds of thousands of kidney patients suffering in the North-Central Province due to lack of proper drinking water, but the government has done nothing to provide safe drinking water for them.   He said at a time when over 400,000 people have been displaced and have lost everything due to floods in many parts of the country; it is ironic the government is focussing attention on such extravagant events squandering millions of public funds that can be utilized for the benefit of the people.   The Deyata Kirula exhibition is estimated to cost Rs 60 billion.   “In fact, what is of national interest at this moment is to provide instant relief amounting to Rs 500,000 per person, to all the 400,000 people who were affected and displaced due to the recent floods. That is the need of the hour,” he said.   Premadasa also said the Deyata Kirula programme was not a national priority. “It may be important for the personal agenda of certain individuals, but it’s not for the people,” he said.

'Opposition and United National Party (UNP) Leader, Ranil Wikcremesinghe, who opted to ride a gondola in Venice, while floods and landslides wreaked havoc in the country affecting over 400,000 people, is expected to return to Sri Lanka today.  Wickremesinghe\'s visit to Italy and his antics in Venice have drawn heavy flak from several quarters, including his own party men, who claim his gondola ride in Venice while Sri Lanka was drowning, was akin to Nero fiddling while Rome burnt.  There has also been heavy criticism about his attempt to obtain free tickets to attend the opera, \'Don Quixote\' which was being staged at the Teatro dell\'Opera di Roma. The tickets were priced at Eruo 150 each. The opera was a charity event to raise funds for Ani AIDS, an Italian AIDS project, and Wicremesinghe\'s or rather attempts by Sri Lanka\'s Ambassador to Italy, Asitha Perera, to obtain free ticket for Wickremesinghe, had reportedly even drawn a few sniggers from the Italian Foreign Ministry officials. He had also tried to obtain free passes to several historical sites, including the Coliseum, Roman Forum, Pentium and Borghese Gallery.  Reports from Rome indicate, following the embarrassing chastisement from Italian officials, Wickremesinghe had purchased tickets to \'don Quixote\' on 29 December. This has compelled one wag to comment that AniAIDS had received a substantial contribution from Sri Lanka, courtesy the Sri Lankan Ambassador, his wife and her maternal Uncle Ranil Wickremesinghe and his wife Professor Maithree Wickremesinghe.  If the cheapskate embarrassment is not enough, sources at the Ministry of External Affairs reveal that Wickremesinghe was forced to abort plans to stay at one of Italy\'s most expensive hotels, the Hilton, after information was leaked out about the plan. According to the source, Secretary, Ministry of External Affairs, was told in no uncertain terms, by those in higher authority, to convey to Ambassador Perera, if he wanted to provide accommodation to his uncle, he should do so at his own expenses. Meanwhile, reports from Italy also reveal that two embassy vehicles had been placed at the disposal for Wickremesinghe and his delegation, comprising his wife and two friends.  Reports also claim that the Opposition Leader had been on a lavish spending spree during the holiday with many deeming it a sacrilege at a time the flood victims in Sri Lanka had been rendered helpless, without even sufficient drinking water.  This is the time for the UNP to make its presence felt and make meaningful contribution to the flood victims, said a commentator, wondering aloud, \"What if the money spent so lavishly in Italy had been donated to families displaced by the floods and earth slips?\" The question merits some thought, as the Italian authorities have on an earlier occasion sent a plane load of goodies for flood victims in Sri Lanka.',other

'Sri Lanka’s year-on-year inflation rate in December 2012 eased to 9.2 per cent against 9.5 per cent a month ago, according to data released by the Department of Census and Statistics.

On absolute terms the CCPI index increased to 168.6 from 167.1 in November.
