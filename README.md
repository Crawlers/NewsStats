NewsStats
=========
This repository is using for our final year project. In this project we are trying to identify crime patterns of Sri Lanka using English newspaper articles. Our objective is to create a model to predict crime patterns using 2012 and 2013 data and validate that model using 2014 data. Currently I am working on improving the news classification module using key word based approach.
