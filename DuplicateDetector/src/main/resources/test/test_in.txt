The suspect, who had led the police to the rest of his gang, during the ensuing exchange of fire between the police and the other suspects in Dimbulagala, had given the slip. The area had been thoroughly surrounded by the army and police personnel. Therefore the police expect an early breakthrough.

In the shoot-out with the suspects two ex-LTTE cadres were killed. After the four-member gang had hijacked the car at Punani, in the Valachchena police area, in the early hours of yesterday, two of them had got off in the Dimbulagala area and the other had proceeded towards Polonnaruwa. The car was intercepted by the army at the Batticaloa Junction and the leader was taken into custody with a T-56 assault riffle. It is believed the fourth suspect had remained in Punani. The hijacked vehicle was a new Elite car bearing the registration number WP KU 2824. The police then elicited information from the suspect on where the other suspects were dropped and went to the exact place where they got off after the robbery. Newly appointed police spokesman Superintendent Buddika Siriwardene told The Island that the suspects on seeing the police started firing at them and the police returned fire.

The police have identified one of the persons believed to have been involved in the killing of a police constable in the early hours of last Tuesday at Kurunegala after abducting him and another on traffic duty. The suspect was a member of the gang responsible for the killing of the constable, the police said. The other policeman was able to save his life by grappling with his abductors and fleeing. The person police are looking for had visited a vehicle rental service in Gokarella, on the eve of the incident and sought to rent a van after producing a bogus driving licence. He had fled after the owner of the establishment felt suspicious and informed the police. Police spokesman SSP Ajith Rohana said though the data contained in the driving licence handed over by the suspect to the vehicle rental service were false, the photograph in it was that of the suspect and it matched the description given by the constable who fled from the custody of his abductors. The photograph in the driving licence and the one reconstructed from the description provided by the surviving PC tallied to a great extent, the police spokesman said. SSP Rohana further said that prior to the abduction the two constables had settled a dispute between a married couple and according to information provided by the escaped PC, a van had been parked close to the scene of the abduction. The images of the suspect van had been recorded on the video footage of a CCTV camera installed in a filling station when they came to rob the place, the police said.
